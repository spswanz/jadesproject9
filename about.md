# **Project Overview** #

The Qing Emperor’s Hindustan Jades integrates text analysis, mapping, and
interactive image viewers to visualize eighteenth-century China’s engagement
with the Islamic world. It was launched as an accompaniment and enhancement
of Dr. Kristina Kleutghen’s upcoming book The Local Exotic: Fabricating Foreign
Taste in Eighteenth-Century Chinese Decorative Arts. The project launched
August 2019 and is currently active.

## Website Content ##

The website currently includes the following
* An interactive map of the **Forbidden City** that includes embedded image viewers
for jade objects stored according to their respective locations.
* Two maps of place name counts found in the poems inscribed onto the jade objects
and place names found in the published historical records.
